# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

can you look at the changes in this branch and let me know what effort it is to fix this: 

The humanModified calculation at line 235 uses min(totalUserAdded, totalUserRemoved) to estimate modifications, but this doesn't distinguish between user modifications to agent code vs. user modifications to their own code. When a user modifies their own previously-added lines (e.g., removes 3 of their accumulated lines and adds 3 different ones), the formula at line 256 (agentLinesInCommit := max(0, tota...

### Prompt 2

how would you track line ownership?

### Prompt 3

how do line hashes work if you have the same line in the file multiple time, like for example `  }` will be there multiple times

### Prompt 4

could we create a summary of the options for this and what we went with (I'd go with option 4 now as a simple improvement) but keep it in the repo. So could we do a ADR doc in docs/architecture too

### Prompt 5

Lets do the implementation too

### Prompt 6

can we rewrite the ADR so it's more like how the whole line attribution feature works now? Like not starting from current bug but write it in the context of the PR/Branch which adds the whole feature. Also don't give it a number and it needs no date or status in the file

### Prompt 7

The CalculatedAt timestamp uses time.Now() which includes the local timezone. For consistency with other timestamps in the codebase that serialize to JSON (like incremental checkpoints), consider using time.Now().UTC() instead. While this is consistent with the existing CreatedAt field in CommittedMetadata (line 329), using UTC would be more consistent with incremental checkpoint timestamps and avoid timezone-related issues when comparing timestamps across systems.

Can we do this, but can you f...

### Prompt 8

Missing UserAddedPerFile field causes lost per-file tracking

Medium Severity

The session.PromptAttribution struct is missing the UserAddedPerFile field that exists in strategy.PromptAttribution. When session state is saved via sessionStateFromStrategy, the UserAddedPerFile map is lost because the destination type lacks this field. This causes estimateUserSelfModifications to always return 0, incorrectly attributing user self-modifications as agent modifications, resulting in under-counted agen...

### Prompt 9

Duplicated comment line in attribution function

Low Severity

Lines 366 and 367 contain an identical duplicated comment: "Track per-file user additions for accurate modification tracking". One of these duplicate lines appears to be accidentally repeated.

### Prompt 10

Low Severity

When reading files from the worktree in calculatePromptAttributionAtStart, binary files are not filtered (lines 1016-1017 use os.ReadFile without null-byte checking). However, getFileContent used for tree content returns empty string for binary files (null-byte check at line 90). This inconsistency causes diffLines(referenceContent, worktreeContent) to compare empty string against raw binary data, producing garbage line counts that inflate UserLinesAdded when binary files are chang...

### Prompt 11

question: doesn't git know if it's a binary file?

### Prompt 12

I think this was just fixed, right: The UserAddedPerFile field is not being converted between session.PromptAttribution and strategy.PromptAttribution. This field is critical for accurate user self-modification tracking (see docs/architecture/attribution.md). Without this conversion, the per-file tracking data will be lost when session state is saved/loaded, causing incorrect attribution calculations in multi-checkpoint scenarios.

Add UserAddedPerFile to the session.PromptAttribution struct and...

### Prompt 13

in manual_commit_attribution: The code uses a heuristic (min-based approach) to split accumulated user edits between agent-touched and non-agent files, but the necessary data already exists in accumulatedUserAddedPerFile to make this split precisely.

Instead of lines 235-236:

accumulatedToNonAgentFiles := min(allUserEditsToNonAgentFiles, accumulatedUserAdded)
accumulatedToAgentFiles := accumulatedUserAdded - accumulatedToNonAgentFiles
Calculate precisely:

var accumulatedToAgentFiles, accumula...

### Prompt 14

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Request**: User asked about fixing a bug in the humanModified calculation at line 235 that doesn't distinguish between user modifications to agent code vs user modifications to their own code.

2. **Analysis Phase**: I examined `manual_commit_attribution.go` and `manual_com...

### Prompt 15

I'd like to do some proper tests with a real repo and a real claude calls, can you help me do that? Like write a script that creates a repo, then run prompts ("add a script that returns a random number"), then adds a file, run another prompt updating that added file and do that all in one script run? Using claude --model haiku and a prompt directly (so it's not interactive)

### Prompt 16

the test isn't really checking the metadata in the entire/sessions commits

### Prompt 18

ah, right! can we change the script so it's using `go run cmd/..` so we are always using the latest code?

### Prompt 19

question: can you check if claude code supports some kind of test/dev mode (especially for plugins/hooks) that simulates as if it talks to an llm but just mocks that part but all the rest functions?

### Prompt 20

no, ignore this part, back to the changes we did for `go run`: 

 create mode 100644 main.py

go: cannot find main module, but found .git/config in /var/folders/gz/h7sjhvz13cb0gcrzzcncqtyw0000gn/T/tmp.kdWp7xUk8V

### Prompt 24

[Request interrupted by user]

### Prompt 25

no revert those changes, I think it's correct if it's part of the commit. What we more should do is after running entire enable is to make an initial commit so we have a clean state and then do the test scenario simulating user additions and claude code generated code

You can continue here, but checkpoints from both sessions will be interleaved.

To resume the other session instead, exit Claude and run: claude -r 0276a600-2f22-4d2b-844c-3feb9c5aa108
