# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

While looking at the logs I noticed a few tokens related fields, can you try making some sense out of it, for example in this log: ~/.REDACTED.jsonl

### Prompt 2

can you check if you find the line that is related to "entire-engineering:review:code-simplicity-reviewer(Review transcript position changes for simplicity)" and show me the tokens?

### Prompt 3

⏺ entire-engineering:review:code-simplicity-reviewer(Review transcript position changes for simplicity)
  ⎿  Done (9 tool uses · 111.2k tokens · 45s)

does this add up then? 111.2k?

### Prompt 4

you think it's possible based on this to calculate the token consumption at the end of a prompt (when the stop hook fires)

### Prompt 5

yes

### Prompt 6

[Request interrupted by user]

### Prompt 7

can you explain the difference between second and third option?

### Prompt 8

are we saving the agent logs in entire/sessions already?

### Prompt 9

yes, please do

### Prompt 10

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial Context**: The session continues from a previous conversation where transcript position tracking was implemented. The user had asked about token-related fields in Claude Code logs.

2. **Token Fields Investigation**: User asked me to investigate token-related fields in the ...

### Prompt 11

hmm looking at this again: it's probably to be expected that other agents will have a totally different model how they store and track tokens, can you check if we abstracted this enough so it's clear this is claude code specific?

### Prompt 12

without doing any changes: can you check the prior things we did to splitting the logs, does that also need to be refactored for claude code specific?

### Prompt 13

I check it, and it is only implemented under auto-commit strategy, why ?
