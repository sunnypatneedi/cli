# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

Right now we store full.jsonl when doing a checkpoint in `entire/sessions` when keeping the session active with claude we commit the growing log in commit after commit. Can we take a look and see if we can get the last row from the current session log at the start of a prompt and then track that for the checkpoint? so we can know what was added during this checkpoint?

### Prompt 2

can you check if we could use the leafUuid? has every row in a log that? then we just safe the last one? Maybe tracking lines is also good to have both.

### Prompt 3

can you double check the log, like this is the log of this current session ~/.REDACTED.jsonl if I look at the first rows they don't have a "uuid" field only a "leafUuid"

### Prompt 4

Yes, also I wonder now if really there is something added to the end only. But let's do this both. We store them in metadata.json then

### Prompt 5

did you add tests too?

### Prompt 6

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Request**: User asked about optimizing how session logs (full.jsonl) are stored during checkpoints. Currently, when keeping a session active with Claude, the full log is committed each time. They want to track the last row from the current session log at the start of a prom...

### Prompt 7

can you tell me how summary.txt is generated in the entire/sessions commit?

### Prompt 8

can you use simplifier and check the changes, especially also the tests if they don't tests go internals for example

### Prompt 9

While looking at the logs I noticed a few tokens related fields, can you try making some sense out of it, for example in this log: ~/.REDACTED.jsonl

### Prompt 10

can you check if you find the line that is related to "entire-engineering:review:code-simplicity-reviewer(Review transcript position changes for simplicity)" and show me the tokens?

### Prompt 11

⏺ entire-engineering:review:code-simplicity-reviewer(Review transcript position changes for simplicity)
  ⎿  Done (9 tool uses · 111.2k tokens · 45s)

does this add up then? 111.2k?

### Prompt 12

you think it's possible based on this to calculate the token consumption at the end of a prompt (when the stop hook fires)

### Prompt 13

yes

### Prompt 14

[Request interrupted by user]

### Prompt 15

can you explain the difference between second and third option?

### Prompt 16

are we saving the agent logs in entire/sessions already?

### Prompt 17

yes, please do

### Prompt 18

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial Context**: The session continues from a previous conversation where transcript position tracking was implemented. The user had asked about token-related fields in Claude Code logs.

2. **Token Fields Investigation**: User asked me to investigate token-related fields in the ...

### Prompt 19

hmm looking at this again: it's probably to be expected that other agents will have a totally different model how they store and track tokens, can you check if we abstracted this enough so it's clear this is claude code specific?

### Prompt 20

without doing any changes: can you check the prior things we did to splitting the logs, does that also need to be refactored for claude code specific?

### Prompt 21

can you make me a simple vizualization of multiple commits for a session and how the log grows and we now know which part belongs to which commit?

### Prompt 22

Question: does this login now work with both auto and manual commit strategies?

### Prompt 23

[Request interrupted by user]

### Prompt 24

ok, I restored the right branch, can you now check - for both token and log position - if this works for both strategies?

### Prompt 25

yes, please outline the plan first

### Prompt 26

is there some special logic right now if the user commits only a subset of files in the first commit?

### Prompt 27

Yes

### Prompt 28

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial Context**: The session continues from a previous conversation where token position tracking was implemented for Claude Code transcripts. The summary mentions:
   - TokenUsage struct added to checkpoint package
   - Token calculation functions in transcript.go
   - Tests for...

### Prompt 29

one additional thing to check: how do we handle this with multi session support?

### Prompt 30

not sure we should sum up the token usage, but do we track the token usage of session 1 in the folder metadata.json?

### Prompt 31

yeah root should show the last session data, this is fine

### Prompt 32

can you check the changes in the local branch against main in regards to what we talked above?
