# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

Right now we store full.jsonl when doing a checkpoint in `entire/sessions` when keeping the session active with claude we commit the growing log in commit after commit. Can we take a look and see if we can get the last row from the current session log at the start of a prompt and then track that for the checkpoint? so we can know what was added during this checkpoint?

### Prompt 2

can you check if we could use the leafUuid? has every row in a log that? then we just safe the last one? Maybe tracking lines is also good to have both.

### Prompt 3

can you double check the log, like this is the log of this current session ~/.REDACTED.jsonl if I look at the first rows they don't have a "uuid" field only a "leafUuid"

### Prompt 4

Yes, also I wonder now if really there is something added to the end only. But let's do this both. We store them in metadata.json then

### Prompt 5

did you add tests too?

### Prompt 6

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Request**: User asked about optimizing how session logs (full.jsonl) are stored during checkpoints. Currently, when keeping a session active with Claude, the full log is committed each time. They want to track the last row from the current session log at the start of a prom...

### Prompt 7

can you tell me how summary.txt is generated in the entire/sessions commit?

### Prompt 8

can you use simplifier and check the changes, especially also the tests if they don't tests go internals for example
